# Draft Tools
*** 

### > Beer Sheets

I used to recommend and use [Beer Sheets](https://footballabsurdity.com/draft-sheet-form/), a tool I found online and everytime I used it it gave good results. I had gotten good feed back from people I've recommneded it to. The original creator has moved on after the 2023 season and the new team has yet to prove they're as good.

#### Usage

You can go to their main page and just copy over the settings from your league. For examples here's a [direct link](https://footballabsurdity.com/draft-sheet-form/?teams=14&bn=5&qb=1&rb=2&wr=2&rwt=2&patd=6&rutd=6&retd=6&payd=0.04&ruyd=0.1&reyd=0.1&int=-1.0&rec=0.5&fum=-2.0) to the settings my family league is using. 

There doesn't seem to be support for PPFD (point per first down) so I just kept it at 1/2 ppr.

## Tools

### > Fantasy Pros

[FantasyPros](https://www.fantasypros.com/). I've used both free and the paid version. The free version is all you need while the paid tools offer quality-of-life (aka just figure it out for me) tools for trading and waiver wire pick ups. 

The paid version does offer syncing multiple leagues but I just use [multiple throwaway accounts](/posts/domainandemail) to bypass the limit. 

## Podcasts and Youtube

### > RotoBaller

[RotoBaller](https://www.rotoballer.com/nfl). Good articles for waiver, start/sit, and latest news on players.

### > Fantasy Footballers

[Fantasy Footballers](https://www.youtube.com/thefantasyfootballers) have a website, tools, podcast and youtube channel. I prefer the youtube channel, it's great for background listening as they're entertaining and long enough for doing stuff around the house. 

### > Late Round with JJ Zachariazon

[LateRound](https://lateround.com/#newsletter) is a podcast which is basically the exact same as the newsletter. Newsletter will usually have +1 bit of info to encourage getting it, e.g podcast covers 10 Waiver Wire Pickups while newsletter has 11. Data backed and pretty accurate. 

### > Rams Brothers

[Rams Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOfbL0Rk-DwcNPy-zFvy8nA) Podcast and youtube channel. LA Rams talk.
